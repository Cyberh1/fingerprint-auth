## Idea
“Student Attendance/Identificator with Fingerprint Reader”. 
Our idea is to use a biometric concept to facilitate the attendance system using the most reliable way of uniquely identifying students through fingerprint readings. Such type of application would be extremely useful in colleges or other organizations requiring daily attendance. Through this application we could keep a systematic track of users (student’s) attendance. 

* Every student could login to the system through fingerprint detection
* Fingerprint comparison for authentication
* Generating a brief report of attendance from the database according to specifications as required.


## Technology
We are planning to use Ionic 3 for the front end and couchDB for the back end database, as well as some graphical database (e.g. Neo4j) to generate statistical information on admins request.
